#+TITLE: Using ClojureScript

This is a sibling document to ./Clojure.org dedicated to ClojureScript.

* How to do AJAX / web communication

- [[https://github.com/ptaoussanis/sente][sente]] :: a small client+server library that makes it easy to build
  reliable, high-performance realtime web applications with Clojure +
  ClojureScript

- [[https://github.com/r0man/cljs-http][cljs-http]] :: returns core.async channels, so you need to
  import the =go= macro and the =<!= function

* Working with HTML

- [[https://github.com/weavejester/hiccup][hiccup]] ::  is a library for representing HTML in Clojure. It uses
  vectors to represent elements, and maps to represent an element's
  attributes. Most other templators (rum, reagent) use this style.

* Reagent
https://purelyfunctional.tv/guide/reagent/
Reagent has its own Atoms. They're just like regular Clojure Atoms in
every way except they do one extra thing: they keep track of Reagent
components who have derefed them. Every time those Atoms change
values, the component will be re-rendered.

* Interop with JavaScript


JS                            CLJS

object.method(arg1, arg2) <=> (.method object arg1 arg2)
object.field              <=> (.-field object)
object.field = "foo"      <=> (set! (.-field object) "foo")
object.nested.field       <=> (.-field (.-nested object))
