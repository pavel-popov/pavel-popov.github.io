* Why Emacs?

I'm a long-time vimmer and tmuxer, having Slime plugin in vim
makes me console ninja, but the power of Emacs has been always a next level
of talking to computers.

I've been using [Spacemacs] for several years already mostly as an
editor for Org-mode files and [Ledger] journals. You don't learn Emacs
with Spacemacs, so I decided to start from scratch.

Configuring bare Emacs looks like a very time-consuming process, so I
decided to start with more slim "Starter Kit" - [Castlemacs] with
[evil-mode].

* Installation

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
‚ùØ gpg --homedir ~/.emacs.d/elpa/gnupg  --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 066DAFCB81E42C40
#+END_SRC

* How to blog using Emacs?
I'm using [Hugo] with [] theme, hosted on GH pages.




* Examples of code blocks

#+BEGIN_SRC go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello world")
}
#+END_SRC
