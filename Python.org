#+TITLE: Python programming language

I've been occasionally using Python since around 2005, and have
several big projects implemented using it, mostly in relation to test
and job orchestration.

* Python2 vs Python3

- In macOS Big Sur the default is still Python 2.

* GIL

Global Interpreter Lock

* Running a web-server for serving static files

#+begin_src sh
python3 -m http.server 8000
#+end_src
