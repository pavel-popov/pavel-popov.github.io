      <description>Why Emacs?   I&amp;#39;m a long-time vimmer and tmuxer, having Slime plugin in vim makes me console ninja, but the power of Emacs has been always a next level of talking to computers.  I&amp;#39;ve been using [Spacemacs] for several years already mostly as an editor for Org-mode files and [Ledger] journals. You don&amp;#39;t learn Emacs with Spacemacs, so I decided to start from scratch.  Configuring bare Emacs looks like a very time-consuming process, so I decided to start with more slim &amp;#34;Starter Kit&amp;#34; - [Castlemacs] with [evil-mode].</description>
